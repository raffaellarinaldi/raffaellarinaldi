I personally co-founded this project in 2009, achieving exponential growth over the years in terms of monthly website visits, Facebook likes, and forum subscriptions. Additionally, we established collaborations with Italian, Japanese, and American licensing companies to promote merchandise through affiliate marketing. This journey provided extensive learning in digital marketing and community management. Presently, the project boasts nearly 150K Facebook likes and is undergoing a revamp using WordPress, Elementor, Kirby, and more.
