Website created for a professional illustrator using Adobe Portfolio, a specific service by Adobe for building a graphic portfolio. It features a simple gallery of illustrations divided into pages. The project was initially based on WordPress but was converted to this platform for better media management. Post-conversion, the site gained in speed and functionality. The starting theme is provided by Adobe and modified to meet the client's needs. Despite being a third-party platform, efforts were made for SEO optimization where possible.
