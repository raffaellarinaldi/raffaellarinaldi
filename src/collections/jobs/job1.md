I collaborate with local businesses to elevate their digital footprint, specializing in crafting websites through carefully selected third-party platforms, CMS, or bespoke development. My involvement extends to shaping brand kits, optimizing pages for SEO, producing content for guest posts, devising comprehensive social strategies (ads and organic), and, upon request, imparting training to equip clients for increased autonomy in managing their digital endeavors. This holistic approach ensures a robust and effective digital presence tailored to individual business needs.
