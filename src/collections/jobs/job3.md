I specialize in developing static and hybrid websites, adhering to the SSG/Jamstack paradigm. Whether porting templates or creating sites from the ground up, I am hands-on with code, ensuring precision. My approach includes implementing an efficient frontend library management workflow, significantly enhancing security, speed, and long-term maintainability. This meticulous strategy results in websites that not only meet functional requirements but also excel in performance.
